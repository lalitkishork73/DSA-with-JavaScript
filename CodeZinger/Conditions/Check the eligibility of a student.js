Marks in Mathematics >= 65, and
Total in all three subjects >= 180 or total in Math and Physics >=140
 

Input:

    65

    51

    72

 

    where:

First line represents the marks obtained in Physics.
Second line represents the marks obtained in Chemistry.
Third line represents the marks obtained in Mathematics.
 

Output:

    Yes

 

Explanation:

Marks obtained in Physics = 65 > 55, Chemistry = 51 > 50, Mathematics = 72 > 65, also total = 65+51+72 = 188 > 180, all the criteria are satisfied, hence the output Yes
 

Assumptions:
