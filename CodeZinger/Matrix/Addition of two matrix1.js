Tags:	ArrayMatrix
Given two matrices, find the addition of matrices.

 

Reference: http://stattrek.com/matrix-algebra/matrix-addition.aspx

 

Write a function solution that accepts integer matrices A1 and A2, number of rows of matrices M as integer, number of column of matrices N as integer. The function should add A1 and A2 and return the result matrix.

 

Input 
    2       
    3 
    5 5 1                                           
    2 3 4 
    2 4 8 
    6 2 2 

    

    Where, 

First line represents the number of rows. (M) 
Second line represents the number of columns. (N). 
Third & fourth line contains 1st and 2nd row of matrix A1. 
Fifth & sixth line contains 1st and 2nd row of matrix A2. 
 

Output 
    7 9 9 
    8 5 6 


For M = 2, N =3 

Matrix A1
    5   5   1 
    2   3   4 

 

Matrix A2
    2   4   8 
    6   2   2 

 

The sum of corresponding elements of both the matrices 
    5+2  5+4  1+8        =   7   9   9 
    2+6  3+2  4+2        =   8   5   6  */
