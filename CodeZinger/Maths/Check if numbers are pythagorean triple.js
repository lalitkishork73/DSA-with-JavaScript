Write a function:
    int solution(int A, int B, int C)

 

that accept three integer A, B and C. The function should return 1 if the given integers are Pythagorean triple else 0.

 

Input
    3
    4
    5

 

    where,

First line represents the value of A.
Second line represents the value of B.
Third line represents the value of C.
 

Output
    1

 

Assume that,

A, B and C are integers within the range [1 to 2,147,483,647]. */
