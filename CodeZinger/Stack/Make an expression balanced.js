Make an expression balanced
Tags:	StackData Structures
Given a brackets expression, find a minimum number of bracket reversals required to make an expression balanced using Stack.

 

Expression-1 =  “}{“ 

Here 2 brackets reversals needed to make expression balanced “{}”.

 

Expression-2 = “{{” 

Here 1 bracket reversals needed to make expression balanced “{}”.

 

Write a function:
        int solution(char* S)

 

that accept brackets expression as string S. The function should return a minimum number of brackets reversals required to convert expression balanced. If a string can not be made balanced bracket expression then return -1.

 

Input
    }{

 

    where,

The first line represents a bracket expression as a string.
 

Output
    2

 

Assume that,

The expression contains only brackets.
brackets can be '{' and '}'.
Length of string can be [1 to 10000]
