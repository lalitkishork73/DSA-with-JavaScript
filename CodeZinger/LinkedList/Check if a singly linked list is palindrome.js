Check if a singly linked list is palindrome
Tags:	Data StructuresLinked list
Given a Singly Linked List, find the list is palindrome or not. 
 

Write function: 
        int solution(struct node *H) 

 

that accept a pointer to the first node in linked the list H of type “struct node”. The function should return 1 if the list is palindrome else 0. 

 

Input 
    5 
    3 2 1 2 3 
     

    where, 

First line represents a size of the linked list. 
Second line represents elements of the linked list. 
 

Output 

    1 
 

Assume that, 

Structure “struct node” is already defined. 
The linked lists are already created based on input provided.
Number of elements in the linked list within the range [ 0 to 1000 ].
